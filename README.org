* setup - UNIX home directory configuration
  Clone into home directory.  Or, clone into 'setup', and mv all files
  into your home directory (or better yet, fork and use your own):

    git clone git://@github.com/pjkundert/setup.git
    mv setup/* setup/.* ~

  It must be configured to excludes all files, by default: to add
  a file for tracking, use: git add -f <filename>.   TO do so:

    echo "*" >> .git/info/exclude
  
** Makefile
   Checks, downloads and builds necessary targets.
